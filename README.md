# Moss

moss is a set of parsing rules for js objects, most often described in YAML-like syntax. It is a Turing-incomplete language that looks a bit like YAMl but is closer Kubernetes Helm. Moss aims to have serparable layers, each with an opinionated first choice that is ultimately swappable if desired. Moss is mainly used to define data input forms. You may be accustomed to HTML forms, which are defined by a developer. Moss forms are different- they are user-defined, both in their schema and their data. Moss forms can draw data and schemas from other Moss forms- together, they form a network not dissimilar to the WWW.

## Branches
Moss "branches" are somewhat like files but with key differences. A traditional file separates its data (the file contents) from its metadata (owner, permissions). In contrast, a Moss branch is identified by its first line, called a "branch locator".

## Branch locators

Example: context::name@Organzation Name~Folder/other tag:version

context aka "forest" - defines which layer 0 resolver to use if sourcing from another forest
name - just a file name.
Organization Name - Represents permissions
projectTags - User defined hints, similar to unix directories
version - server or a hash

## Layers of moss
```
0 binary
1 source
2 linked structured ast
3 declarative api
```
### Layer 0: "trunk" / container / binary:
opinionated default:
+ [Signet Protocol](https://github.com/ChromaPDX/signet), which is essentially an IPFS compatible container format

unopinionated alternatives:
+ database
+ filesystem
+ browser storage

### Layer 1: "branch" / source code:
opinionated default:
+ yaml

unopinionated alternatives:
+ JSON / xml / TOML
+ any trie-like format

### layer 2: "stem" / ast:
opinionated default:
+ js-moss (this package) hydrates yaml to object, async gql resolvers for linking

unopinionated alternatives:
+ load layer 1 into language specific ORM
+ be able to link other layer 2 objects.

### Layer 3: "leaf" / document:
opinionated default:
+ has a "kind" referenced in layer2
drives declarative api like k8s

unopinionated alternatives:
+ any runtime object
